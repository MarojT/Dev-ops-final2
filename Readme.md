## Service Mesh with HashiCorp Consul
  
Demo project accompanying a [Consul crash course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3I1kKKfjtQ) on YouTube

### Terraform commands to execute the script

```sh
# initialise project & download providers
terraform init

# preview what will be created with apply & see if any errors
terraform plan

# exeucute with preview
terraform apply -var-file terraform.tfvars

# execute without preview
terraform apply -var-file terraform.tfvars -auto-approve

# destroy everything
terraform destroy

# show resources and components from current state
terraform state list
```

#### Get access to EKS cluster
```sh
# install and configure awscli with access creds
aws configure

# check existing clusters list
aws eks list-clusters --region eu-central-1 --output table --query 'clusters'

# check config of specific cluster - VPC config shows whether public access enabled on cluster API endpoint
aws eks describe-cluster --region eu-central-1 --name myapp-eks-cluster --query 'cluster.resourcesVpcConfig'

# create kubeconfig file for cluster in ~/.kube
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region eu-central-1 --name myapp-eks-cluster

# test configuration
kubectl get svc
```

### ðŸ“‚ Kubernetes
The microservices and supporting configurations are deployed to Kubernetes. Here's a breakdown:

`config.yaml` -> Base service and deployment definitions (pre-Consul).

`config-consul.yaml` -> Modified manifests that include Consul annotations.

`consul-values.yaml` ->   Helm values used to configure Consul installation.

`consul-mesh-gateway.yaml` -> Defines a gateway for cross-cluster or multi-datacenter service communication.

`exported-service.yaml` -> Makes services accessible across clusters.

`service-resolver.yaml` -> Provides fallback or failover behavior for services between environments (e.g., Linode â†’ EKS).

### ðŸ“‚ Terraform
`main.tf` -> Core configuration combining modules and resources.

`providers.tf` -> Declares used providers like AWS, Helm, and Kubernetes.

`variables.tf` -> Defines configurable input variables.

`terraform.tfvars` -> Contains values for variables such as AWS credentials.

## GCP source codes
This [demo project](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) made by Google Cloud Platform.

**Online Boutique** is a cloud-first microservices demo application.  The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.
